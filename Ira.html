				<p>Parenting Assistant</p>
				<h3>Brief</h3>
				<p>The project was to redesign the platform focusing on to improve the UX.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<h3>Challenge</h3>
			<p>Design a game where the game objectives have to be in line with the learning objectives</p>
			<h4>Duration</h4>
			<p>3 Months</p>
			<h4>Questions</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>The complete design process from User Research to Prototyping.</li>
				<li>UX for learning.</li>
				<li>How interactive products can be used for learning.</li>		
			</ol>
			<h3>Methods</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>User Research</li>
				<li>Competitive Analysis</li>
				<li>Skethes</li>
				<li>Prototyping</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>The goal was to design a game/puzzle that would reinforce the content learnt on the platform. A proper study of the user (Both Parent and Child) was done to understand the context. Other competitors in the market was also looked into to understand the current solutions and oppurtunities to improve. An analysis of the learning material was done to understand the type of learning involved and their objectives. A puzzle game was designed where the gameplay is to gain mastery of the learning objectives. After prototyping, the game was playtested to evaluate the design.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Whats On The Market?</h3>
			<p>Gained an understanding over the current products and their users by:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reading reviews of each products.</li>
				<li>Talking to customer support of each brand to understand how the service is designed.</li>
				<li>Blogs by parents on how they manage their children (those which fall in the K-5 age group).</li>
				<li>Articles by experts on parenting and playing with kids.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Who Are We Designing For?</h3>
			<p>Personas were developed at this stage.</p>
			<p>Key Insights:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Mothers are more concerned about how kids are spending their time.</li>
				<li>Working parents have less leisure time and wants to utilise that in spending quality time with their children.</li>
				<li>Mothers are running out of how to keep their kids engaged.</li>
				<li>The energy levels of the kid and the parent dont match especially when the parent is tired after their work.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Customer journey was mapped to see what are the oppurtunities in the scenario of a mother searching for such a product and finally buying one.</p>

			<h3>What Are They Learning?</h3>
			<p>The learning objectives were taken and categorised according to the cognitive function involved in learning them. These objectives were set as the game objectives and their underlying cognitive function becomes the gameplay. They are:</p>
